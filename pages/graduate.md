## Master of Liberal Arts
The hallmark of the [MLA program](https://www.temple.edu/academics/degree-programs/liberal-arts-mla-la-liba-mla) is its interdisciplinary flexibility in allowing students to develop their own intellectual and career pathways. MLA students can choose from a range of courses and disciplines in both the MLA program and other College of Liberal Arts graduate programs that meet their needs and interests, including art history, history, English, anthropology, psychology, philosophy, sociology, religion, political science, African American studies, and geography and urban studies.

## Transfer of Credit
Students are expected to complete all of the MLA course requirements at Temple. However, up to six hours of graduate credits may be transferred from another institution with the approval of the MLA Advisory Committee and the Dean of the Graduate School. The credits must be equivalent to coursework offered at Temple, and the grade must be a “B” or better. The MLA Admissions Committee makes recommendations on transfer credits to the Director of the MLA Program.

The Request for Transfer of Graduate Credit form should be filled out and submitted to the MLA office after matriculation to the program.
