## Master of Liberal Arts in Liberal Studies Program Overview

The hallmark of the MLA Program is its interdisciplinary flexibility in allowing students to develop their own intellectual and career pathways. MLA students can choose from a range of courses and disciplines in both the MLA Program and other CLA graduate programs that meet their needs and interests, including Art History, History, English, Anthropology, Psychology, Philosophy, Sociology, Religion, Political Science, African American Studies, and Geography and Urban Studies. The MLA Program affords students the opportunity to participate in a varied and rich network, improve their analytical, research, and writing skills, challenge themselves intellectually, and enhance their current positions or open doors to new career possibilities.

## Academic Offerings

- [Master of Liberal Arts](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/liberal-arts-mla/)
- [Program Requirements](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/liberal-arts-mla/#programrequirementstext) 
- [Admission Requiements](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/liberal-arts-mla/#admissiontext) 

## Transfer of Credit

Students are expected to complete all of the MLA course requirements at Temple. However, up to six hours of graduate credits may be transferred from another institution with the approval of the MLA Advisory Committee and the Dean of the Graduate School. The credits must be equivalent to coursework offered at Temple, and the grade must be a “B” or better.  The MLA Admissions Committee makes recommendations on transfer credits to the Director of the MLA Program.

The Request for Transfer of Graduate Credit form should be filled out and submitted to the MLA office after matriculation to the program.

## Coursework Taken as a Non-Degree Seeking Student

Up to nine hours of graduate study taken at Temple prior to admission may be credited toward the degree with the approval of the MLA Advisory Committee and the Dean of the Graduate School. In order for graduate courses taken at Temple as a non-degree seeking student to count toward the degree, the earned grades must be “B” or better.

## Course Offerings

[MLA courses](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/liberal-arts-mla/#courseinventory) are usually offered in small seminar settings (7 to 12 students) which provide opportunities for lively engagement and exchange of ideas among the students and the professor. As with most graduate courses, students may be expected to give oral presentations and to submit written assignments, often including a substantial end-of-term paper.

Most MLA courses are offered during the evening at Temple University’s Center City campus at 1515 Market Street, very close to City Hall. A typical course meets once a week, from 6:00 to 8:30 p.m.  Some online or "blended" courses, with variable meeting times, may also be offered.

In addition, a number of other graduate courses in the College of Liberal Arts and across the University are offered on Main Campus, typically during the day or early evening. The MLA program also offers cross-listed courses with other academic departments.

## Registering for courses:

**Non-Degree Seeking** students interested in registering for MLA courses need to first contact the [Office of Continuing Studies](http://www.temple.edu/vpus/arc/continuingstudies/continuingstudies.html) (see especially [Graduate Students](http://www.temple.edu/vpus/arc/continuingstudies/continuingstudies.html#graduate) section).

**Newly Admitted Degree Seeking** students will be registered by the MLA program during the first semester of enrollment (to include, barring any complications, MLA 5011 Introduction to Interdisciplinary Studies).

After the first semester of enrollment, all CONTINUING DEGREE SEEKING students should be able to register on their own via Self-Service Banner in TUportal. See our [registrar page](http://www.temple.edu/registrar/students/registration/info.asp) for general information regarding registration. 

## Independent Study

Students may register for up to three credits of MLA 9082 Independent Study as part of the MLA Program. Students must submit a proposal to the department under the direction of a faculty sponsor, who will then supervise the Independent Study. The proposal must be submitted the semester before the Independent Study is to be undertaken. The student will be registered by the department for MLA 9082 Independent Study credits once the project is approved.

**All Independent Study Proposals Must Include**

- Independent Study Proposal Request Form
- Rationale for undertaking the project
- Anticipated outcomes or goals of the project
- Works to be studied
- Frequency of student-instructor meetings
- Writing assignments
- Means of assessing the project
