## Online BA in Liberal Studies
The online Bachelors of Arts in Liberal Studies degree is a 123-credit program with the same core curriculum as the on-campus Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies degree program. However, all courses are completely online, allowing the program to fit seamlessly into the busy work and life schedules of working adult students. 

The program is only for nontraditional transfer students (freshman students are NOT eligible to enroll). You can transfer up to 78 eligible transfer credits previously completed at Temple or another accredited institution(s). And because your professional experience is as valuable as your academic experience, you may also submit a portfolio to receive up to six additional credits for prior professional work experience. That means all the hard work you’ve done in the classroom and on the job will count towards your Liberal Studies bachelor’s degree, expediting your timeline to graduation.
