The **Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies** allows you to design your own plan of study through flexible academic tracks in humanities or social sciences. The degree will help you meet your personal and professional goals, expand your critical thinking, research and communication skills, and take your career to the next level. 

The **Master of Liberal Arts** allows graduate-level students to participate in a varied and rich student and faculty network across different generations, academic interests and professional ambitions. You can tailor your own course of study based on your academic interests, professional objectives, and personal goals while selecting from a broad range of course offerings without being confined to a single department or discipline. This program will challenge you intellectually, improve your analytical, research, and writing skills, and open doors to new career possibilities.
