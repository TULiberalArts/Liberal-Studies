He has published articles in such journals as Jazz Perspectives, Social Semiotics, Textual Practice, Rhizomes, Contemporary Aesthetics, Popular Music and Society, and the Oxford Handbook of Philosophy in Music Education, and is currently writing a book on poststructuralism and music. Since 2009, Dr. Szekely has also held week-long seminars at the prestigious Chautauqua Institution in western New York on such topics as: “American Music,” “Nietzsche, Vital Philosopher,” “The Beats,” and “Philosophy and Interdisciplinarity.” Also a practicing musician and composer with a particular interest in collective improvisation, Dr. Szekely studied jazz at the Hartt School of Music (Hartford) led by the late saxophonist Jackie McLean and percussion with drum master Milford Graves at Bennington College, VT. He has performed and/or recorded with Hawk Tubley & The Ozymandians, Anthony Braxton, Dave Liebman, Bobby Zankel, the Daniel Blacksberg Trio, Heath Watts, Feet Music, and singer-songwriter Courtney Parker, and has collaborated with a number of other musicians and groups contributing to the improvisational music scene in Philadelphia, notably Reel, The Scriptors, Transitional Objects, Jack Wright, Several Wolves, and Trio Rhizome.
